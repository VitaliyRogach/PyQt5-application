# Meeting with PyQt5
## Calculator
### In this project, I first worked with the PyQt5 framework and learned the basics and technologies. The project involves a calculator with 4 steps. There are also links and a calendar.

## How to get started with a project?

1. `pip install -r reqirements.txt`
2. `python main.py`
